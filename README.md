# Simple Flutter Trivia App for web and hybrid technologies course.



Here are some possible features for a trivia game app:

User authentication: The app could allow users to sign up and log in to their accounts to save their game progress, score, and other preferences.

Categories: The app should offer different categories of trivia questions, with a varying degree of difficulty. Users should be able to select the category they want to play and have access to a variety of questions.

Leaderboard: A leaderboard can be implemented to display the scores of the top players in each category, creating a sense of competition between users.

Difficulty levels: The app should offer multiple levels of difficulty for each category, so users can choose the level of challenge they prefer.

Timed game: The app could offer timed games with a set amount of time for each question. This would increase the challenge and add a sense of urgency to the game.

Help options: The app could provide options for users to get help with the questions, such as 50/50, or ask the audience.

Sound and graphics: The app could include sound effects and graphics to create an immersive experience for the user.
